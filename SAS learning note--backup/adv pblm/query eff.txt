When summarizing data for one or more class variables, the tools in each of the following groups are similar in resource usage:

PROC MEANS (or PROC SUMMARY), PROC REPORT, and PROC TABULATE
PROC SQL and the DATA step with PROC SORT.

a relatively small number of distinct combinations of values of the class variable—the summarized data contains 10% or fewer of the observations in the original data set	
PROC MEANS (or PROC SUMMARY)
PROC REPORT
PROC TABULATE

a relatively large number of distinct combinations of values of the class variable—the summarized data contains more than 10% of the observations in the original data set	
PROC SQL
DATA step and PROC SORT

Using a GROUP BY statement in PROC SQL is similar in CPU usage to a PROC SORT step followed by a DATA step.

The TYPES statement in a PROC MEANS step uses the fewest resources. 

A program that contains the NWAY option in multiple PROC MEANS steps uses the most resources because SAS must read the data set separately for each PROC MEANS step. 

The WHERE= data set option in a PROC MEANS step uses more resources than the TYPES statement in PROC MEANS because SAS must calculate all possible combinations of class variables before subsetting. However, the WHERE= data set option in PROC MEANS uses fewer resources than the NWAY option in multiple PROC MEANS steps.
