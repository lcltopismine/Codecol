restrict the number of rows that PROC SQL displays or writes to a table		OUTOBS=
proc sql inobs=5; 


The NUMBER | NONUMBER option specifies whether the output from a query should include a column named ROW,
     proc sql inobs=10 number;            
        select flightnumber, destination 
           from sasuser.internationalflights;

The DOUBLE | NODOUBLE option does not affect the appearance of the HTML output.
Double-space the output	DOUBLE | NODOUBLE
proc sql double;

The FLOW | NOFLOW | FLOW=n | FLOW=n m between n and m
option does not affect the appearance of HTML, PDF, or RTF output.

proc sql inobs=5 flow=10 15;

Option for Testing and Evaluating Performance
Specify whether PROC SQL writes timing information for each statement to the SAS log	STIMER | NOSTIMER

The STIMER option in PROC SQL is useful when an operation can be accomplished in more than one way and you are benchmarking each technique.

     proc sql outobs=5;
        select flightnumber, destination 
           from sasuser.internationalflights;
     reset number;
        select flightnumber, destination 
           from sasuser.internationalflights
