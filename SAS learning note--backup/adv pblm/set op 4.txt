ALL	
Makes only one pass through the data and does not remove duplicate rows.
ALL cannot be used with OUTER UNION.


Corr
Compares and overlays columns by name instead of by position:

When used with EXCEPT, INTERSECT, and UNION, removes any columns that do not have the same name in both tables.

When used with OUTER UNION, overlays same-named columns and displays columns that have nonmatching names without overlaying.

   select *
      from one

      from two;
