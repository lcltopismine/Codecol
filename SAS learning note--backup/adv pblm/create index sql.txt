Determining Whether SAS Is Using an Index
OPTIONS MSGLEVEL= N | I;
The IDXWHERE= option enables you to override the decision that SAS makes about whether to use an index
IDXWHERE=YES | NO;


     proc sql;
        select *
           from marchflights (idxwhere=no)
           where flightnumber='182';

     proc sql;
        select *
           from marchflights (idxname=daily)
           where flightnumber='182';
